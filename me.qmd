With a strong foundation in statistics, I specialize in data analysis and programming, proficient in Python, RStudio, and Java. My technical expertise is complemented by experience in Microsoft Office, which I use for effective data-driven decision-making and project management. Alongside my technical skills, Iâ€™ve developed a deep understanding of human behavior and business strategy through courses in psychology and business, as well as hands-on experience in HR, Marketing and Sales, where I gained insights into talent management and organizational dynamics.

Passionate about blending technology and creativity, I aspire to make a meaningful impact in the industry, using my skills to help bring ideas to life and create memorable experiences.
