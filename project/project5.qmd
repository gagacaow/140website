This study investigates the key predictors that determine the likelihood of a YouTube video receiving above-average likes using a dataset of 364 videos. We performed logistic regression with forward selection to create our final model.       

Our analysis indicated that shares, new subscribers, and watch time are the most significant in predicting the odds of a video receiving above-average likes. The final logistic regression model, after removing outliers, achieved an accuracy of 94.11% with an AIC of 108.17.                

Conversely, variables such as new comments, day of the week, total views, and interactions between shares/day of the week and new comments/day of the week were not found to significantly increase the likelihood of receiving above-average likes.
